Scripts and patches to build ROM for S II Plus

How to get:
Run 'git clone https://github.com/andixlm/build_tools' in root of ROM sources directory.

Description of scripts:
resync.sh - reset all changes in ROM sources, sync and get prebuilts.
-----
patch.sh - patch ROM sources to make them work with S II Plus.
-----
build.sh - build ROM for S II Plus. It asks for cleaning of 'out' directory (make clean) and device (s2ve or s2vep), then build for chosen device. Also it handles first argument ('--s2ve' or '--s2vep'). If it's used, then it'll build ROM for chosen device without cleaning. To build boot image (or recovery image) for device defined in first argument without the whole ROM building use second argument '--mb' ('--mr' for recovery).
